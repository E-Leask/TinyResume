# TinyResume
The goal of this project is to create a interactive resume styled site to show off your project and experiences
The initial build is heavily based on the code from the TinyPhysics example on the [ProjectTinySamples Repo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ProjectTinySamples)

This is current the prototype to work handle the desired capabilities of this project
#### Desired Capabilities
- [x] Movable Player  
- [x] Images  
- [x] Text (Note: Unity Tiny currently does not support multi line text so this part will be tedious)  
- [x] Interactable Physics  
- [ ] Custom Playermodels
- [ ] Changing character model on the fly (a couple projects include vehicles so it would be fun to hop in them and "drive around")
